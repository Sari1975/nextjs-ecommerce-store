Create a products page

A page for each single product (when you click on the product it goes to its specific page)
A shopping cart page (containing a list where products appear when you click on the "Add to cart" button on the single product page), which also shows the total price of all products
A checkout page / multi-page process which shows the total and asks for shipping and payment information (when you click on "Go to Checkout" on the shopping cart page it goes here)
A thank you page after a checkout has been completed
The header will show a shopping cart with the current number of items on all pages
